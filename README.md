# ToDo Amos and Gian
- When progress bar is full (Counter = 5) change background image (whether player won or opponent won) -> Create new images
- When the background image is changed, the circle that is clicked must also change its position
- If the frog is licked = Make the game easier 
- Possibly different background image when won/lost? -> Create new images
- When progress bar is full the squares in the progress bar must be changed/deleted.

# Problems
- When enemy progress bar is full, the image does not change. -> Problems with EnemyState
